# 🏗️ INFRA-DRISHTI  
### Vision for a Safer Bharat 🇮🇳

**INFRA-DRISHTI** is a national-scale, AI-assisted infrastructure intelligence platform designed to **monitor, analyze, simulate, and predict structural risk** across India’s critical infrastructure—bridges, highways, tunnels, flyovers, dams, and strategic assets.

It integrates **government datasets, historical incident records, live telemetry concepts, and physics-based engineering models** to move infrastructure governance from *reactive repairs* to *preventive foresight*.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

India’s infrastructure monitoring systems are:
- Fragmented across departments  
- Largely manual and reactive  
- Triggered after visible damage or failure  

This leads to **avoidable structural collapses, economic loss, and public safety risks**.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

INFRA-DRISHTI provides a **unified digital command layer** for infrastructure health by combining:
- National asset registries  
- Engineering decay models  
- Predictive risk scoring  
- Scenario-based stress simulation  
- Governance-ready dashboards  

The result is **early warning, audit prioritization, and decision intelligence** at a national scale.
